## Abstract
Traffic analysis is crucial for urban operations and
planning, while the availability of dense urban traffic data
beyond loop detectors is still scarce. We present a large-scale
floating vehicle dataset of per-street segment traffic information,
Metropolitan Segment Traffic Speeds from Massive Floating Car
Data in 10 Cities (MeTS-10), available for 10 global cities with
a 15-minute resolution for collection periods ranging between
108 and 361 days in 2019â€“2021 and covering more than
1500 square kilometers per metropolitan area. MeTS-10 features
traffic speed information at all street levels from main arterials
to local streets for Antwerp, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago,
Istanbul, London, Madrid, Melbourne, and Moscow. The dataset
leverages the industrial-scale floating vehicle Traffic4cast data
with speeds and vehicle counts provided in a privacy-preserving
spatio-temporal aggregation. We detail the efficient matching
approach mapping the data to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road
graph. We evaluate the dataset by comparing it with publicly
available stationary vehicle detector data (for Berlin, London,
and Madrid) and the Uber traffic speed dataset (for Barcelona,
Berlin, and London). The comparison highlights the differences
across datasets in spatio-temporal coverage and variations in the
reported traffic caused by the binning method. MeTS-10 enables
novel, city-wide analysis of mobility and traffic patterns for ten
major world cities, overcoming current limitations of spatially
sparse vehicle detector data. The large spatial and temporal
coverage offers an opportunity for joining the MeTS-10 with
other datasets, such as traffic surveys in traffic planning studies
or vehicle detector data in traffic control settings.
