## Abstract

Dashboards are an increasingly popular form of data visualization. Large, complex, and dynamic mobility data present a number of challenges in dashboard design. The overall aim for dashboard design is to improve information communication and decision making, though big mobility data in particular require considering privacy alongside size and complexity. Taking these issues into account, a gap remains between wrangling mobility data and developing meaningful dashboard output. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that bridges this gap to support the mobility dashboard development and design process. In this paper we outline a conceptual framework for mobility data dashboards that provides guidance for the development process while considering mobility data structure, volume, complexity, varied application contexts, and privacy constraints. We illustrate the proposed frameworkâ€™s components and process using example mobility dashboards with varied inputs, end-users and objectives. Overall, the framework offers a basis for developers to understand how informational displays of big mobility data are determined by end-user needs as well as the types of data selection, transformation, and display available to particular mobility datasets.
